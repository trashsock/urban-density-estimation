# urban-density-estimation
Traditional census techniques, conducted periodically, often fail to reflect real-time population dynamics, especially in rapidly expanding, populous regions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that employs a feature-based knowledge distillation framework to estimate housing density as a proxy for population distribution. 
Our method utilises satellite images to determine house counts and applies an average household size to estimate population density, offering a cost-effective and computationally efficient solution for interim population estimation. This approach is particularly valuable for regions with limited resources. Extensive validation in densely populated areas of India demonstrates that our method achieves high accuracy in complex urban environments, providing a practical and timely alternative to traditional census methods.
